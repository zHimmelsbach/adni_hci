title: A Cheaper Way to Target Expensive Diagnostic Techniques for Alzheimer's?
---


### Project Motivation

Clinicians use FDG-PET scans to determine the degree of hypometabolism (unusually low metabolic activity) in a patient's brain. These measurements can help predict whether a patient with Mild Cognitive Impairment is likely to develop Alzheimer's Disease. However, these scans are very expensive. 


### What if we could find a way to target PET scans to patients with the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's? 

We decided to see if we could use patients' answers to questions from cognitive tests (which are cheap to administer) to predict the extent of hypometabolism in the brain.
