The glucose molecules aggregate in the regions of highest metabolic activity; thus, low levels of radioactivity indicate low levels of glucose, which corresponds to hypometabolism in those regions of the brain.\n",

    "\"HCI\" stands for \"Hypometabolic Convergence Index\", a measure developed by the Banner Alzheimer's Institute that indicates the degree to which a patient's FDG-PET brain scans correspond to those of a patient with an Alzheimer's diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2011 paper, a team at BAI found that HCI predicted whether or not a patient with Mild Cognitive Impairment would develop Alzheimer's better than other biomarkers (hippocampal volume, amyloid and tau proteins in cerebral spinal fluid), memory test scores, and clinical assessments (Chen et al, 55-57).\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalization, HCI values range between 0 and about 30. Chen et al found that an 8.36 threshold value for the HCI (determined using an ROC curve) resulted in a 6.55 hazard ratio under the Cox Proportional Hazard Model when controlling for other variables. This \"hazard ratio\" indicates that for every unit increase in HCI beyond the threshold, the patient's chance of developing Alzheimer's is 6.55 times as likely (Chen et al, 57).\n"

    "We developed our models using patient's results on seven cognitive exams:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADAS (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale)**:  ADAS primarily measures language and memory. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The tasks include word recall, naming objects & fingers, remembering test directions, comprehension, word-finding difficulty, following commands, orientation (e.g. knowing the date), constructional praxis (e.g. drawing increasingly complex shapes that are shown to subject), and ideational praxis (e.g. asking the subject to *pretend* to write a letter, fold it, put it in envelope, and place the stamp).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)**: CDR measures cognitive and functional performance. Final composite CDR scores range from 0 to 3; higher scores indicate higher stages of dementia (i.e. more severe symptoms). CDR covers six areas: memory, orientation, judgement & problem-solving, community affairs, home & hobbies, and personal care. Administering the CDR takes a significant amount of time, but the test has high inter-rater reliability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**FAQ (Functional Assessment Questionnaire)**: FAQ measures a patient's ability to perform the \"activities of daily living.\" Higher scores indicate greater dependence. The ten questions on FAQ cover tasks such as writing checks, doing taxes, and shopping. FAQ has been shown to be capable of distinguishing between mild cognitive impairment and \"very mild alzheimer's disease.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale)**: At the time of the ADNI-1 trial, GDS was a self-report assessment of 15 yes-or-no questions (15 additional items were added in later phases). Higher scores indicate greater depression. Examples of questions include, \"Are you basically satisfied with your life?\", \"Do you often get bored?\", and \"Do you feel full of energy?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**MMSE (Mini Mental-state Exam)**: The MMSE is a 30 item questionnaire that measures factors similar to ADAS. Higher scores indicate better functioning. Unlike ADAS, the MMSE does not require a trained professional to administer. However, the test is observed to be affected by age and education demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**MHS (Modified Hachinski Scale)**: The MHS test attempts to differentiate between Alzheimer's and dementia. It must be administered by a physician. A score of 2 or less predicts Alzheimer's; a score of greater than 2 predicts dementia. However, according to the GP Notebook (see link below under \"Sources\"), \"recent research has shown that the Hachinski score has no predictive value when using autopsy as the gold-standard diagnostic tool.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "** NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire)**: The NPI is administered to caregivers rather than the patients themselves. It has high interrater reliability and, according to the American Psychological Association, is able to screen for multiple types of dementia. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. Example questions include \"Does [the patient] believe people are stealing from him/her?\" and \"Does [the patient] appear to feel too good or act excessively happy?\"\n"

Another study followed patients with mild cognitive impairment over a five year period (Palmqvist et al, 2012). It explored predicting the development of Alzheimer's using the results of cognitive tests administered at baseline, including the MMSE. The authors found that the MMSE combined with a clock drawing test predicted the development of Alzheimer's as well as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.\n",
